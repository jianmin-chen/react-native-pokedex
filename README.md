Let's build a Pokedex with React Native in forty-five minutes! You don't need to know any React Native before going through this, but you will need the following:

* JavaScript and React (hooks, etc.)
* Basic knowledge of Git and GitHub
* Basic knowledge of APIs - we will be using [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
* A computer (duh) with a code editor and a phone or emulator to test your creation 
    * macOS: Xcode
    * Windows and Linux: Android Studio
* The requirements for running an Expo app, which we will discuss in more detail later:
    * `expo-cli`, which will let us create Expo projects in the command line
        * Make sure you meet Expo's [requirements](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) for installation
        * The Expo app, which you can find in the App Store or the Play Store

The final code is located on GitHub at [https://github.com/jianmin-chen/react-native-pokedex](https://github.com/jianmin-chen/react-native-pokedex). If you're following along, you might like to work in terms of milestones. In that case, you can `git clone` the repository and then `git checkout` any of the following branches at any time to follow along:

* `milestone-1-preview-cards`: The first milestone, where you create preview cards for the Pokemon
* `milestone-2-search-functionality`: The second milestone, where you add search functionality to the app
* `milestone-3-navigation`: The third milestone, where you add navigation to the app to create a bigger info page.
* `master`: The final milestone and the final project! Here, you'll set up local storage to create a Favorites screen where you can add your favorite Pokemon.
