### Before We Start

Some of the things we'll cover:

-   What React Native is
-   Setting up React Native with Expo
-   Building an app with React Native using features like:
    -   Forms that interact with APIs
    -   Local storage

### Prerequisites

Before we get started, some prerequisites:

-   JavaScript + hopefully React
-   Basic knowledge of APIs - we will be using [PokeAPI](https;//pokeapi.co/)
-   A computer (duh) and a phone or emulator to test your creation

That's it!

### Disclaimer

A 90-minute workshop is quite short, so deciding what to put in here was tough. Ultimately, the goal is to learn enough React Native to write a pretty cool app, so efficiency and code optimization won't be discussed here.
