## Building a Pokedex with React Native!

Build a Pokedex with React Native in this workshop and learn React Native along the way!

### Getting Sarted

Project code is included inside `/pokedex`, while workshop slides are included inside `/slides`. To get started, make sure you have the following:

* JavaScript + hopefully React
* Basic knowledge of APIs - we will be using [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co)
* A computer (duh) with a code editor and a phone or emulator to test your creation
    * macOS: Xcode
    * Windows and Linux: Android Studio
* The requirements for running an Expo app:
    * `expo-cli`, which will let us create Expo projects in the command line
        * Make sure you meet Expo's [requirements](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) for installation
    * The Expo App, which you can find in the App Store or the Play Store

`git clone` this repository and then `cd` into the `/pokedex` folder and run `npm i && npm start` to spin up an Expo demo, which you can then view on your phone. To take a look at the slides, `cd` into the `/slides` folder and run `npm i && npm run dev` to spin up the slides, which were created with [https://sli.dev](sli.dev).
