## Building a Pokedex with React Native!

Build a Pokedex with React Native in this workshop and learn React Native along the way!

### Getting Sarted

Project code is included inside the `master` branch, while workshop slides are included inside the `slides` branch. To get started, make sure you have the following:

* JavaScript and React
* Basic knowledge of APIs - we will be using [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co)
* A computer (duh) with a code editor and a phone or emulator to test your creation
    * macOS: Xcode
    * Windows and Linux: Android Studio
* The requirements for running an Expo app:
    * `expo-cli`, which will let us create Expo projects in the command line
        * Make sure you meet Expo's [requirements](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) for installation
    * The Expo App, which you can find in the App Store or the Play Store

`git clone` this repository and then run `npm i && npm start` to spin up an Expo demo in the `master` branch, which you can then view on your phone with the Expo app. To take a look at the slides, `git branch` into the `slides` branch and run `npm i && npm run dev` to spin up the slides, which were created with [sli.dev](https://sli.dev).
